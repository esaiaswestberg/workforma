# Workforma

This project is written as Lab 3 for the 1dv610 course at Linnaeus University. Workforma is supposed to be a simple web application to allow users to:

1. Register and login to the application
2. Create forms
   2.1. Forms can have different types of fields which are validated using `ts-fuse` from Lab 2.
   2.2 Forms can be private (password protected) or public (no password)
3. Fill out forms and submit them
4. View submitted forms
